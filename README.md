# Michael & Eagle Lettings - Fan Page Mockup

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A MOCKUP FAN PAGE** ⚠️

This website is a **parody/fan page mockup** inspired by the fictional "Michael & Eagle Lettings" from the TV show "Stath Lets Flats". 

## About This Project

- **NOT A REAL BUSINESS**: This is not an actual lettings agency
- **PARODY CONTENT**: All property listings, descriptions, and content are fictional and created for entertainment purposes
- **FAN TRIBUTE**: Created as a humorous tribute to the brilliant BBC comedy series "Stath Lets Flats"
- **MOCKUP DESIGN**: Intentionally designed to look like a cheap, poorly-made website (as would fit the show's aesthetic)

## Technical Details

- Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Intentionally includes spelling mistakes, broken English, and garish design choices
- Property descriptions written in the style of Stath Charalambous's character
- Design mimics what you'd expect from a £20 WordPress developer

## Credits

- Inspired by "Stath Lets Flats" created by Jamie Demetriou
- All content is fictional and for entertainment purposes only
